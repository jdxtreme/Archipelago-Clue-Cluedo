 - Tabletop Simulator (https://store.steampowered.com/app/286160/Tabletop_Simulator) with a Clue/Cluedo Steam Workshop addon

Note, from here on out in this document, for consistency’s sake, the game will be referred to as Clue and use North American spelling and names.
# Introduction
While enjoying a vacation with 6 of his closest known associates at his mansion in the Bahamian Archipelago, Mr. Boddy was found murdered in his home. Nobody’s got an idea of what happened, but all they know is that a strange force compelled them to. With evidence scattered across space and time, it’s up to you to find out WHO did it, with WHAT, and WHERE.
# Setup
- Ensure your Archipelago Launcher is up-to-date, and install the Clue: Mystery in the Archipelago APWorld as normal.
- Generate the YAML, and send it to the host, or, if you are the one hosting, place the YAML in your Players folder, then generate as normal and create the room as normal
- Shuffle the Suspect, Weapon, and Room decks separately, and, without looking, place one of each into the solution envelope.
- Set the Suspect tokens and Weapons off to the side or put them back into the box for now.
- Send the “Game Start” and “Starting Key” checks, and draw 3 Clue cards.
# Gameplay
The objective of Clue: Mystery in the Archipelago is to figure out who killed Mr. Boddy, with what weapon, and in which room. Each room is its own check, and same with meeting all suspects, and retrieving each weapon. You can score these checks by entering the same room as the suspect/weapon. However, you will notice that Tudor Manor is completely empty at the start of the game, and you cannot enter every room right away. Each room’s key, guest, and weapon is an item that needs to be found in another player’s APWorld. 

When you receive a key for a guest or a weapon, place it in a currently unlocked room, or if there are no rooms unlocked, keep them off to the side until a room key is found. If you have multiple at a time, place them down in this order:
- Suspects: Scarlett→ Mustard→ White→ Green→ Peacock→ Plum
- Weapons: 🗡Knife→ 🔫Revolver→ 🧶Rope→ 🚰Lead Pipe→ 🔧Wrench→ 🕯️Candlestick
  Along your investigation, you may receive Clue cards. If you happen to gather all but one card in a single set (5 Suspect, 5 Weapon, 8 Room), you may send a check for the item involved in the murder, and place the weapon/suspect in any room, even if it’s locked. If you happen to collect all cards involved in the murder, you’ve completed your objective and caught the killer! Send the “Solve the Murder” check to broadcast your victory, and release all remaining items in your APWorld.
# Alternate Rule: Rumors and Accusations (Deathlink)
  This alternate rule involving Deathlink requires another player to verify that you do not cheat. Before beginning play, have another player look inside the envelope. Then have them write down the solution somewhere, but do not have them show it to you.
	For every death, you may make a rumor. Simply declare a recently collected suspect, weapon, and room, and have your answer keeper tell you if any part of it is wrong. If it is, they must tell you if it’s the Suspect, Weapon, or Room. If there are multiple incorrect options, they may only tell you one.
	Once you feel that you have sufficient evidence to prove the murder, declare that you are going to make an accusation, and declare the Suspect, Weapon, and Room, and ask the Answer Keeper if that is the solution in the envelope.
## Did you get it right?
  Congratulations! You’ve cracked the case and caught the killer! Send the “Solve the Murder” check to declare your victory! Make sure to verify that all players are good for a release first.
	
  If not, send a death for other Deathlink players, and tell the answer keeper NOT TO TELL YOU WHAT PART OF YOUR ACCUSATION IS WRONG.
